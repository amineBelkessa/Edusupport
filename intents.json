It’s okay to take breaks during the event to recharge. Remember, socializing doesn’t have to be perfect, and just showing up is already a success. You’re not alone in feeling this way, and each experience can help build your confidence."

Start by setting specific limits on your social media usage, such as time restrictions or designated no-phone hours. Use apps that track your screen time and help you stay accountable. Replace scrolling with other activities that bring you joy, like reading, exercising, or spending time with loved ones. Engage in mindful tech use by being selective about what you consume and who you follow. Remember, taking breaks from social media can improve your mental health and allow you to reconnect with the real world around you."

        "Fear of making mistakes can paralyze you, but mistakes are a natural part of growth. Shift your perspective to see mistakes as learning opportunities rather than personal failures. Reflect on what you can learn from each mistake and how it can help you improve. Set realistic expectations for yourself, and allow room for errors as part of the process. Practice self-compassion by reminding yourself that everyone makes mistakes—it’s what you do afterward that counts. Remember, no one succeeds without stumbling along the way, and each mistake brings you closer to your goals."

Set specific times for breaks where you can indulge in your distractions guilt-free, and use productivity tools like timers or apps that limit your screen time. Create a structured routine that includes dedicated work and relaxation periods. Replace unproductive habits with positive ones, like reading, exercising, or working on a hobby. It’s okay to enjoy downtime, but finding balance is key. Remember, progress takes time, and making small changes can lead to better habits over time."

Prioritize your tasks by urgency and importance, and tackle them one at a time. Delegate or seek help with tasks when possible, and don’t be afraid to set boundaries or say no to new commitments. Create a schedule that includes breaks and self-care to maintain your energy levels. Remember, you don’t have to do everything perfectly or all at once—focus on making steady progress.

Seek out communities or friends who share or respect your sense of style. Remember, your style is a reflection of your personality, not a measure of your worth.
